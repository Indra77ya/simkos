## 2024-10-24 - Dashboard Modernization
**Learning:** Adding a modern touch to legacy layouts (Bootstrap 3/Ace Admin) is most effective with subtle shadows, rounded corners, and generous whitespace. Overriding legacy borders with `border: none !important` and replacing with `box-shadow` instantly lifts the UI.
**Action:** When modernizing old admin panels, focus on card-like containers and interactive hover states for data widgets.
